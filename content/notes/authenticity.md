Authenticity happens when you shift your focus from the results of your acting
(eg. other peoples reactions to you), and towards your inner honest motives and
your honest character. Acting on those means acting authentically.

I used to focus 100% on the world's reaction to me. The switch flips when I
consciously decided to no longer focus on this. But to focus entirely on what I
truly felt and wanted in any given situation, and to honestly express that.

It's also a letting go, and a giving up. No longer trying to be anything else
than I already am. Seeing yourself as the person you really are, and accepting
what you see, and acting on it.

That also means that acting authentically while altering your behaviour to get
certain results from the world is a contradiction in and of itself. It's not
possible. You can't behave in ways that don't reflect your honest self and
simultaniously act honestly. That means acting authentically in order to be
perceived as an authentic person doesn't work either. Acting with the goal to be perceived in
some desired way is in itself unauthentic. Only acting on what you truly feel is
authentic.

The good news is: authenticity is acquired through subtracting. You don't need
to add anything, you don't need to develop some new perspective or some new
behaviour. All you need to do is listen closely to what you truly want and feel
- and to do the subtraction by giving up on anything else. 

That's why shifting to authenticity is a relief, you feel lighter the moment you
let go of all your masks. 

The biggest challenge here is acting authentically in moments you feel bad.
Authenticity means truly accepting and expressing who you are, and that includes hard feelings
like fear, insecurity, doubt or sadness. Accepting those and being honest about
them is key here.

A few months ago I was invited to a party and I hadn't been very social for a
while. When I got there I felt insecure, and was concerned about people noticing
my insecurity. My automatic reaction was fighting that insecurity, and trying to
hide it. Then a beautiful girl girl sat next to me and asked me how it was
going. 

That was the moment I gave up on getting rid of my insecurity and instead
answered: 'You know what, actually not that good. I haven't been among people
for a while and right now I feel a bit insecure here with all those folks.' I
instantly felt better. And she understood what I had said, we had a nice
conversation and later that night she said me being honest about my insecurity
instantly made the whole interaction authentic and pleaseant for her.

Acting like this often isn't easy. But it gets easier when you think of it as
freeing yourself of your masks and allow yourself to express what you truly
feel.
