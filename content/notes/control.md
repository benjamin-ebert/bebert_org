For the last one and a half years, I dated a beautiful girl. She really was all I could dream of in a potential partner. I always felt like we just weren't really connecting. I felt like we both were wearing some kind of a mask, and that there wasn't that much of a connection going on. That's why I finally ended it (and also because I felt other girls were interested in me and I wanted to test it).

Almost instantly I started regretting this decision. Dating other girls I realized all of her great qualities and what a beautiful human being she was. I started to want her back. I felt a number of things:

Regret of my own decision
Sadness of having hurt and maybe lost her
Fear of how it would all turn out, and whether I was to ever meet her again.

I spent a couple of days feeling miserable, before I found out how to deal with such emotions:

Regret of my own decision: My decision is a thing of the past, and therefore cannot be changed, no matter how much I regret it.
Sadness of having hurt or lost her: give it it's room, as it's natural
Fear of her reaction: Just as with the first point, this wasn't something within my control.

Point one and three are things totally outside my control. It does not make sense stressing out about those - it's like stressing out about bad weather.

The thing to focus on always is the thing that's in our control. In my case that meant focusing on showing her my appreciation for her and clearly and honestly communicating what was going on inside me and what I wanted. Everything else was only causing unnecessary trouble.
