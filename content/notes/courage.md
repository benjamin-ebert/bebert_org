Acting with courage becomes easier once you shift your perspective on it a
little bit. Courage isn't necessarily that big bold move that offers much to
gain and much to lose. It doesn't have to be kicking in the door with a lion
roar, hoping to win and fearing, or ignoring the possibility to lose. It doesn't
have to be that big risky thing.

Courgage after all, means acting honestly in the face of possible rejection. And
this isn't kicking in doors, it's more like opening up your own door, letting
others see what you truly want and feel. It's simply that: showing the world
what you honestly want and feel, even if they don't like it. It's not an attack
or a bold move - it's simply opening up.
