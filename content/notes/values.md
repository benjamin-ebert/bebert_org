Values are rules you act on. They give a clear outline what to do, say and think in
any given situation. More importantly they give peace of mind. They work like a
basis you can return to and ask for direction.

There are good values and there are bad values. Bad values are outside of your
control (what others think of you) and can be accomplished like material goals (getting rich).
Examples from my own experience are: Fucking more women, being perceived in
certain ways, always feeling good about myself.

Good values are within your control (the way you look at yourself and
others) and can be lived up to on a daily basis (acting honestly.)
Examples from my own experience are: Honesty, Vulnerability, Self-acceptance.

Give much thought about which ones you pick, because they have a fundamental
impact on how you act and feel. The good news and also the most powerful thing
about values is: it's 100% your choice.

But only picking them and keeping them in your mind isn't enough. You must act
on them and this is often uncomfortable and scary. Talking and acting honestly,
being vulnerable and opening yourself up for rejection is much easier said than
done. But it gets easier the more you practice. 

And the rewards are worth it. Although I'm not yet acting on my values as
much as I wish to, the benefits I got so far are: More confidence, more
authentic relation ships, Resilience, a stronger sense of self and of who I am,
less fear of rejection and failure, and therefore more success in different
areas of life.

Of all the personal development stuff I've read and learned, conscioulsy
deciding upon my values had the most impact. 

To me it seem like many people follow great values instinctively, maybe because
of how they were raised. I acted on some crappy values for the bigger part of my
life and my advice to anyone interested in personal development is examining
their values.
