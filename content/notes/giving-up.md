I often find myself struggling with some unpleaseant feeling: insecurity,
self-doubt, anxiety, nervousness, depression. My instincitive reaction is trying
to get rid of those feelings by changing the way I think about or look at
things ("You don't need to prove anything" or "It doesn't matter what they
think" and the likes).

What's going on behind the scenes though is this:
By trying to get rid of negative emotions, I reject them. But they are part of
who I am, so that means I am rejecting myself. And rejecting myself is in and of
itself a terrible experience.

Here's the better option:
Instead of trying to get rid of negative emotions, I give up on doing anything
about them. I stop trying to change anything. I accept my mood as it is. I give
up. ("Alright, so I am obviously anxious right now, and there seems
nothing I can do about it. Well then anxiety, here you are, be my guest, enjoy
your stay. Beer's in the fridge.)

I accept my feelings just the way they are, which means I accept myself just the
way I am. And this is in and of itself a positive experience, and often makes
things better instantly.
