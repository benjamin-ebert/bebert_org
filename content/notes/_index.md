# Things I try to remember

My notes are not meant to be advice, since I dont't feel entitled  to teach anybody. I may
likely be wrong about everything. The notes are just ideas I came across that
turned out to be helpful to me. I write them down so I don't forget. When I'm
addressing "you", that's really just me talking to myself. I made everything
public because why not, others may or may not benefit from it.  If you do, cool.
But that's completely up to you.
