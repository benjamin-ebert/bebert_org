# Things I try to remember

Most of my mental growth happens through reading, testing and reflecting.  When
I think I'm onto something, I write a note to help me remember it. We all have
problems and I guess a lot of us share similar ones. That's why I put these
notes here.  I'm not a coach or anything, I'm 24 and probably [wrong]
(https://google.com) about most stuff. But if the notes help me, maybe they'll
help others too.
