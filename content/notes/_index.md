# Things I try to remember

Most of my mental growth happens through reading, testing and reflecting. 
When I think I really got something, I write a
note to help me remember it. We all have problems and I believe a lot of us share
similar ones. That's why I put these notes here.
I'm not a life coach or anything, I'm 24 and
probably [wrong] (https://google.com) about most stuff. But if the notes help
me, maybe they'll help other folks too.
