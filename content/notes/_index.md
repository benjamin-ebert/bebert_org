# Things I try to remember

My notes are not advice, since I dont’t feel entitled to teach anybody. Maybe
I'm wrong about everything. The notes are just things I learned that turned out
to be helpful to me. I write it down so I don’t forget. When I’m addressing
“you”, that’s really just me talking to myself. I made everything public because
why not, might be helpful to someone. If that's you, great.  If you got useful
criticism, even better.
