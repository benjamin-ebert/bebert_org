# Things I try to remember

Most of my mental growth happens through reading, testing and reflecting. 
When I think I really got something, I write a
note to help me remember it. We all have problems and I believe a lot of us share
similar ones. That's why I put these notes here, links to the books are
included for further reading. I'm not a life coach or anything, I'm 24 and
I think I'm [wrong] (https://google.com) about most stuff. I still think the notes can help some folks
if they helped me.
