# Things I try to remember

My notes are not to be seen as advice, because I don't see myself in the
position to teach anybody. I'm 24 and probably wrong about most stuff. The notes
are just stuff I learned that turned out to be helpful to me. I write it down so
I don't forget. Since I write anyway, I might as well go public, so there's a
chance for others to benefit. But really, that part is completely up to
you.
