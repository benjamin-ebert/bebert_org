# Things I try to remember

My notes are not advice, since I dont’t feel entitled to teach anybody. I may
likely be wrong about most stuff. The notes are just things I learned that
turned out to be helpful to me. I write it down so I don’t forget. When I’m
addressing “you”, that’s really just me talking to myself. I made everything
public because why not, others may or may not benefit. If you do, cool.
If you got useful criticism, even better.
