# Things I try to remember

Most of my mental growth happens through reading, testing and reflecting.  When
I think I'm onto something, I write a note to help me remember it. We all have
problems and I guess a lot of us share similar ones. That's why I put these
notes here.  I'm not a coach or anything, I'm 24 and probably [wrong]
(https://google.com) about most stuff. But if the notes help me, maybe they'll
help you too.

My notes are not to be seen as advice, because I don't see myself in the
position to teach anybody. I'm 24 and probably wrong about most stuff. The notes
are just stuff I learned that turned out to be helpful to me. I write it down so
I don't forget. Since I write anyway, I might as well go public, so there's a
chance for others to benefit. But really, that part is completely up to
you.
