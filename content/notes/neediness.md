Emotional neediness means altering your natural behaviour in the presence of
others, so they may like you, or think you're cool/intelligent/honorable, or
simply not reject you.

Emotional neediness with other people, in particular male neediness with women,
comes from a lack of comfort with your own vulnerability. It is not caused
solely by the desire for sexual intimacy, or by actually needing another person
to be happy. It is a need for outside validation, caused by a lacking sense of
self, and an inability to accept and be open with ones shortcomings. 

A person with a strong sense of self, who is aware of, comfortable with and open
about his shortcomings does not feel a lack of selfworth because of his
shortcomings. Therefore he does not feel a need to counterbalance anything by
gaining validation from others. He does not reject himself for his shortcomings,
which leads to a feeling that everything is going to be all right, no matter
what other people do, say or think about him. Therefore he does not need
anything from them e.g. he is not needy.

Non-neediness is gained by coming to know yourself, particularly those things
you like to overlook, and fully accepting who you are. In my case that meant:

1. Realizing that I'm actually pretty introvert and have a lot of self doubt.
2. Being honest with myself: Accepting this and learning to feel okay about it,
   instead of judging myself for it.
3. Being honest with others, telling them about my struggles if they want to
   hear, and not pretending I was cooler and louder than I actually am.

This is the second big step in becoming less needy: Being open about your
shortcomings in front of others, after accepting them for yourself. Not altering
your behaviour because your fear rejection, but saying what you truly think and
feel in the face of possible rejection. Rejection becomes a lot less threatening
when you stop rejecting yourself for your shortcomings. When you accept who you
are, it does not matter if others do.
