- There's a strong emotion, like fear, anxiety, stress, grief or anger
- There's an anchor, like your breath, your footsteps, the room you're in
- When cold, be thoroughly cold. When hot, be thoroughly hot.
- Feel the feeling, closely exmine it, name it. Experience it, like you would
  experience warmth of a sun beam on your skin, or a cool breeze in your face
- Not judging it, but acknowledging it as an experience of life, not more, not
  less. Experience the wave and ride it out. 
- Let the experience exist, give it it's room. Shift your focus to your anchor,
  to reality, realize that the feeling is separate from it.
- Rest like you would rest on the bottom of the sea, take a seat at your anchor
  resting in the sand. This is your breath, your peace, your true value system.
- Look upwards and see your ship from below, floating on the surface, being
  pushed and torn by the wild ocean. This is your emotional state, sometimes
  aroused, sometimes calm, but always in a temporary, fluent continuum.
- Realize that you can chose how you want to react, given your safe seat at your
  anchor
