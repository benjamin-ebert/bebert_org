When you have a goal and think about what to do to reach it, ask this question:

What is the one thing I can do, that if I do it, will make everything else
easier or unnecessary?

That gives you a different perspective: You start focusing on high-impact measures.
And you weed out all the other stuff that may seem helpful, but
doesn't necessarily get you there as fast.

This works perfectly with splitting up a big goal into smaller goals:

To reach my big five year goal X, what is the one thing I can do, that will make
everything else easier or unnecessary? If the answer to this is a smaller
subgoal to reach first, ask:

To reach my crucial one year subgoal Y, what is the one thing I can do, that
will make everything else easier or unnecessary? Which will leave you with some
smaller subgoal, and you ask the question again for a shorter term.

Break your one things down to what you can do right now, do it, and you made
your life a whole lot easier.
