What happens does not matter. What matters is how you respond. You cannot control what happens to you or how others act or if it rains today or not. If you accomplish a certain goal often isn't completely up to you, no matter how hard you worked or how well you were prepared. You may fail, you may have worked in vain, you may get screwed over. It's not up to you. What is up to you is how you respond - do you get pissed and blame the world or other people? Or do you keep up your values, practice resilience and act not impulsive but with reason?

Your response to what happens is not limited to how you act. It begins earlier - you choose how you evaluate things as soon as they happen. You choose how you look at things. You choose to give something meaning in the first place. The things themselves do not have inherent meaning. It's your perception and evaluation of things that gives them meaning - good, bad, or none at all.

How you respond is the one thing that is in your hand when faced with things you cannot control. Circumstances, other peoples actions, even your own emotions.
