It's worth thinking about what content we consume when we take a break. I used
to go for short form content (videos, blog posts, etc.) but recently
turned to classic literature.

I thought: Now that I goof off, what kind of entertainment will add the highest
possible value to the goofing? How can I turn regular goofing into high quality
goofing?

Chances are, a book that lasted for decades and inspired millions can give me 
something that my average random youtube video won't.
A peek into the mind of a great thinker or a random blogpost?
A scroll down my twitter feed or a close look at a famous painting? 

As with equipment, food, clothes, why not take the highest quality available in
entertainment?
