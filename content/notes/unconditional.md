Action uncoditionally is hard but incredibly liberating. It means treating yourself and others as ends, never as means, as Kant has put it. It means that you speak the truth no matter the consequences. That you act and speak honestly in the face of rejection. That you don't alter your behaviour to make a positive impact or to preserve harmony. That you do things because they are inherently right, no matter what the outcome is. That you don't do things that are inherently wrong, even if the outcome is promising to you. That you interact with people not in a transactional way, but in an unconditional way.

It means letting go of hope for things to be better, or different in the future. It means accepting what IS, and acting virtuous in every moment. Unconditionality shifts your focus from results to actions. From altering and bargaining what is right for the sake of some outcome, to doing what is right, because it is right.
