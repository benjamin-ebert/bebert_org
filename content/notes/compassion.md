Compassion helps against the validation addiction, because it fundamentally
changes the way you look at people. You shift from a perspective of threat,
mistrust, separatedness to a perspective of connectedness and brotherhood and
understanding. "They" become "We". Validation is transactional - you act in a
certain way so others will react in a certain way. You have limited control over
the outcome. Compassion is non-transactional. You exercise love for people,
because it's inherently right. Not because of some desired outcome. You have
complete control over this.

Compassion is like saying: "Yeah I see, you're different in a number of ways,
but we're all humans after all aren't we? We all have to eat, drink and sleep.
We're all scared, confused and frustrated sometimes. And we all want to be loved
and understood. So let's keep that in mind when dealing with each other. Now
let's have a beer buddy."

Going through your day with a mind of compassion is relaxing, because you can't
feel trust and connectedness while also feeling separate and threatenend and
accepted only under certain conditions (which the validation mind leads to).

And it helps with accepting yourself just the way you are, because you can't
have a friendly and welcoming mindset to the world, without having it for
yourself.

Ironically, people seem to be attracted to this, so it generates a whole lot
validation for you. But keep in mind not to let that creep in but to let it go
as soon as you feel it's there again.
