- Permanently changing what you think and feel can only be done by changing your values
	- you can't simply decide not to be concerned of what others think anymore
	- you have to feel the underlying value, which also creates the positive
	  counterpart
	- you have to axe both of them
	- and ideally replace them, with a better, opposite value
	- then you have to install the new value by acting on it
	- this is often scary but necessary because only experiences will install
	  the new value
	- after a while the new value will become part of your identity and alter
	  the way you look at things, what you think and feel about them and how you
	  act on them
	- the old value becomes irrelevant

- In the process of installing the new value, that is, painfully acting contrary
  to the old one, mindfulness is very helpful
- it helps to temporarily anchor you in the present moment, making you less
  attached to the feelings your old value summons (anxiety)
- by being less attached to your thoughts, you can act contrary more easily
- it calms you the fuck down
- it helps to identify thoughts and feelings as just that: thoughts and
  feelings. therefore it helps to put them away from your perspective, like
  putting down shitty sunglasses.
