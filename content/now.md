# What am I at right now?

Getting used to working full time while doing freelance gigs on the side,
reading a lot of classic stuff and recording my third solo album. Also making sure I socialize
enough so my social anxiety doesn't take over.

This now-page is inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now).
