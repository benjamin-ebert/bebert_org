# Hi world, here's my stuff

This site exists because I think output should be out there, and not be forgotten sitting on hard drives. My kind of output happens to be code tutorials, music and notes on life. If just one person finds some of that helpful or entertaining, this site met it's goal.

Other than that, I am a web developer from and still living in [Halle] (https://google.com), eastern Germany. I enjoy DIYing stuff, I'm introvert and I think slowly. If you want to work with me, drop me an email at [info@bebert.org] (mailto:info@bebert.org).
