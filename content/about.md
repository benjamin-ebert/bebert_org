# Hi world, here's my stuff

This site exists because I think output should be out there, not rot away on
hard drives. My kind of output happens to be music, code tutorials and notes on
life. If someone other than myself finds that helpful or entertaining, this site
met it's goal.

Other than that, I am a web developer from and still living in [Halle]
(https://google.com), eastern Germany. I enjoy DIYing stuff, I'm introvert and I
think slowly. If you want to work with me, drop me an email at [info@bebert.org]
(mailto:info@bebert.org).
